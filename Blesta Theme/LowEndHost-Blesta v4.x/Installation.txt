Installation:

You will have 3 folders, each folder for the color-theme you like. Choose your favourite one.

Inside it you will have the "php template" and "blesta template".

PHP Template = HTML Template of the theme, very easy to edit.
Blesta Template = Blesta Integration for the HTML template.

To install Blesta Template go to app/views/client inside your Blesta installation folder and paste the template there. 
Than activate it at your Blesta Dashboard - > Look and Feel -> Template name

To change footer links inside Blesta go to 
app/views/client/lowendhost/structure.pdt and at the bottom of that file you'll have the links of the footer. Basic HTML knowledge required.

Good luck!

Installation:

You will have 3 folders, each folder for the color-theme you like. Choose your favourite one.

Inside it you will have the "php template" and "blesta template".

PHP Template = HTML Template of the theme, very easy to edit, though you'll need a local server such as XAMPP to edit/view.
Blesta Template = Blesta Integration & Theme for the main HTML template.

To install Blesta Template go to app/views/client inside your Blesta installation and upload the template color you like there
(blesta template not HTML/PHP template). 
Than activate it at your Blesta Dashboard - > Look and Feel -> Template name

To change the footer links for the theme, go to
app/views/client/lowendhost-theme/structure.pdt 
and at the bottom of that file you'll have the links of the footer. Basic HTML knowledge required.

Good luck!
